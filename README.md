# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub!

## About Me
I'm **Dryver Finch**, a geographer specializing in **remote sensing, UAV-based imaging, and geospatial analysis** for land and resource monitoring, conservation, and ecological restoration. My research integrates **satellite and UAV-based multispectral/hyperspectral imaging** with **machine learning techniques** to support sustainable management of natural resources and hydrological systems.

I'm currently pursuing an **M.S. in Geography** at **The University of Tennessee, Knoxville**, where I also work as a **GIS Lab Assistant and Graduate Teaching Assistant**. I have previous experience as a **research intern at Oak Ridge National Laboratory** and have worked on projects involving **AI-driven object detection, UAV-based LiDAR/multispectral, and ML in remote sensing**.

## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests
- **Hydrological & Riparian Remote Sensing**: UAV-based LiDAR and multispectral imaging for ecosystem monitoring.
- **Geospatial AI & Machine Learning**: Developing AI/ML algorithms for remote sensing applications.
- **Critical Data Studies**: Exploring accessibility, utility, and privacy in geospatial technologies.
- **Spatial Epidemiology**: Investigating the spatial dynamics of **Bacillus anthracis** in West Texas.
