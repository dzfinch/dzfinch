## 🌍 About Me  

I’m a geographer and remote sensing researcher passionate about automating geospatial workflows and improving how we monitor Earth’s dynamic landscapes. My work integrates satellite and UAV data, high-performance computing, and open-source software to solve applied environmental problems.

At UTK, I serve as a **Teaching Assistant** for:  
- **GEOG 413: Remote Sensing of the Environment** – image classification, spectral indices, and change detection  
- **GEOG 314: Introduction to Uncrewed Aerial Systems** – flight safety, FAA regulations, and ASPRS-standard mapping workflows

## 🧶 Plaknit  

**Plaknit** (Planet + Knit) is an open-source framework for stitching Planet strips, UAV tiles, and other raster sources into analysis-ready mosaics.  

- Designed for both local and HPC environments  
- In-memory masking and compositing using OTB + GDAL  
- Modular CLI for spectral index computation and normalization  
- Lightweight alternative to proprietary pipelines
